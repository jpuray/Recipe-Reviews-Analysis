# Recipe-Reviews-Analysis
In this project we studied the relationship between the minutes and average rating of a recipe. We wanted to learn if the time it takes for a recipe to be cooked had any effect on the average rating of that recipe. More specifically, we wanted to know if shorter recipes shorter recipes (40 minutes or less) would have a higher average rating than longer recipes (40 minutes+).
